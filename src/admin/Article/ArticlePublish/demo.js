<figcaption>One language, one person.</figcaption></figure><p>This may be the first time you hear 
about this made-up disorder but it actually isn’t so far from the truth. Even the studies that were 
conducted almost half a century show that <strong>the language you speak has more effects on you than 
you realise</strong>.</p><p>One of the very first experiments conducted on this topic dates back to 1964. 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9440038_Language_and_TAT_content_in_bilinguals">In the 
experiment</a> designed by linguist Ervin-Tripp who is an authority expert in psycholinguistic and<mark 
class="marker-yellow"> sociolinguistic stud</mark>ies, adults who are bilingual in English in French were 
showed series of pictures and were asked to create 3-minute stories. In the end participants emphasized 
drastically different dynamics for stories in English and French.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Another ground-breaking experiment which included bilingual Japanese women married to American men 
in San Francisco were asked to complete sentences. The goal of the experiment was to investigate whether or 
not human feelings and thoughts are expressed differently in <strong>different language mindsets</strong>. 
Here is a sample from the the experiment:</p><figure class="table"><table><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Engli
sh</th><th>Japanese</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr>
<td>Real friends should</td><td>Be very frank</td><td>Help each other</td></tr><tr><td>I will probably beco
me</td><td>A teacher</td><td>A housewife</td></tr><tr><td>When there is a conflict with family</td><td>I do
what I want</td><td>It's a time of great unhappiness</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>More recent 
<a href="https://books.google.pl/books?id=1LMhWGHGkRUC">studies</a> show, the language a person speaks affects 
their cognition, behaviour, emotions and hence <strong>their personality</strong>. This shouldn’t come as a 
surprise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">since we already know</a> 
that different regions of the brain become more active depending on the person’s activity at hand. Since str
ucture, information and especially <strong>the culture</strong> of languages varies substantially and the lan
guage a person speaks is an essential element of daily life.</p>`;
